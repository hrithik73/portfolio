When doing animations in react native we have two options either to use `Animated` from react-native or you library called
[react-native-reanimated](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/)

React Native Reanimated provide the better APIs than react-native's `Animated`
In this blog post we are going to explore the `react-native-reanimated` library and how can we create animations
We will go from basic to complex

## Setup the library

If you already have react native project setup skip this step

```bash
npx react-native init RNAnimation
```

```bash
yarn add react-native-reanimated
```

Add `react-native-reanimated/plugin` plugin to your `babel.config.js`

```js
  module.exports = {
    presets: [
      ... // don't add it here :)
    ],
    plugins: [
      ... // Other plugin
      'react-native-reanimated/plugin',
    ],
  };
```

The plugin performs automatic workletization of certain functions used with Reanimated to reduce the amount of boilerplate code.

Note: `react-native-reanimated/plugin` has to be listed last.

## Glossary

Here we are going to understand some of the terminologies used in this library

### Shared Value

A shared value is a driving factor of all your animations.
You can think of it as a React state which is automagically kept in sync between the “JavaScript” and the “native” side of your app (hence the name).
You create shared values using a useSharedValue hook:

```jsx
import { useSharedValue } from 'react-native-reanimated';
```

```jsx
const sv = useSharedValue(0);
```

### Animated component

Animated components are components which Reanimated can animate.
Reanimated comes with just a handful of built-in components like `Animated.View`, `Animated.ScrollView`, or `Animated.ScrollView`.

### Animation function

Animation functions are functions which let you create animations. They are building blocks that describe how your animations should behave.

Reanimated comes with 3 built-in animation functions:

`withSpring` lets you create spring-based animation
`withTiming` lets you create an animation based on duration and easing
`withDecay` lets you create animations that mimic objects in motion that move with a given deceleration rate
These functions can be combined with animation modifiers to create rich and complex animations.

### Worklet

Worklets are short-running JavaScript functions that can be run on the UI thread.
They can also be run on a JavaScript thread just as you would run a function in your code.
Most of the time when working with Reanimated the code is automatically workletized and run on the UI thread by default.

### JavaScript thread

JavaScript thread (or JS thread for short) is responsible for handling JavaScript code execution in the app.
This is the primary place where the React Native app code is executed.

### UI thread

UI thread is responsible for handling user interface updates. Also known as Main thread.
You can learn more about it by reading the Threading model article in the official React Native docs.

Enough defination let's build something

Let's make a basic animation

![](assets/basic.mov)

```jsx
import { Button, View } from 'react-native';
import Animated, { useSharedValue, withSpring } from 'react-native-reanimated';

export default function Basic() {
  const width = useSharedValue(100);

  const handleIncrement = () => {
    width.value = withSpring(width.value + 50);
  };
  const handlerDecrement = () => {
    if (width.value >= 0) {
      width.value = withSpring(width.value - 50);
    }
  };

  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1, alignItems: 'center', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
      <Animated.View
        style={{
          width,
          height: width,
          borderRadius: width.value / 2,
          backgroundColor: 'violet',
        }}
      />
      <View style={{ bottom: 50, position: 'absolute' }}>
        <Button onPress={handleIncrement} title='Make Bigger' />
        <Button onPress={handlerDecrement} title='Make Smaller' />
      </View>
    </View>
  );
}
```
