So i have been working with react native since a long and everytime
i start a new project i keep doing the same steps while configuring the libraries
so i thought of creating a boilerplate for myself with commonly used libraries which i user in almost all of my project

This is a guide on how to create yours using `react-native-cli`

## Using react-native-cli

Using react native cli

### Step 1 :

Create a new folder

```bash
mkdir rn-boilerplate
cd rn-boilerplate
```

Here `rn-boilerplate` is the name of your project you can name anything

now run `npm init` command

```bash
npm init
```

it will open the prompt enter the necessary details

```json
{
  "name": "rn-boilerplate",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A boilerplate for you next react-native app",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "Hritik Singh",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```

### Step 2 :

Now create a file `template.config.js` and `script.js`

You can do it by terminal or gui

```bash
touch template.config.js script.js
```

The template config file consist the details about the template name, placeholder etc,
and script.js will execute after the successfull template initialization

Add following in the `template.config.js`

```js
module.exports = {
  // Placeholder name that will be replaced in package.json, index.json, android/, ios/ for a project name.
  placeholderName: 'ProjectName',

  // Placeholder title that will be replaced in values.xml and Info.plist with title provided by the user.
  // We default this value to 'Hello App Display Name', which is default placeholder in react-native template.
  titlePlaceholder: 'Hello App Display Name',

  // Directory with the template which will be copied and processed by React Native CLI. Template directory should have package.json with all dependencies specified, including `react-native`.
  templateDir: './template',

  // Path to script, which will be executed after initialization process, but before installing all the dependencies specified in the template. This script runs as a shell script but you can change that (e.g. to Node) by using a shebang (see example custom template).
  postInitScript: './script.js',
};
```

postInitScript is optioonal if you don't want to execute anything after initialization you can simply just comment the 3rd line

inside `script.js` add this

```js
#!/usr/bin/env node

console.log('This is post init script');
```

### Step 3 :

Generate the a new Project with `Placeholder` name in `template` directory , to do than you can simply run the
following command

```bash
npx react-native init ProjectName --directory template
```

### Step 3 :

- Go to template
- Run the application in `android` and `ios`
- Make change

### Step 4 :

Now to generate a new project using your template you have to host it on github on a public repository
Just push the code to github

### Step 5 :

Create a new project using your boilerplate by using `url`

```bash
npx react-native init YourAppName --template https://github.com/hrithik73/rn-boilerplate
```

Replace the YourAppName to whatever the application name you want and the github url will be your boilerplate's github url

Note : For some reason having the issue with postInitScript , if you you also face this just comment for now
